    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Logan';
    let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Mace';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log('team: ', team);
    // console.log('players: ', players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'Li';
    // console.log('team2: ', team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[1] = 'KJ';
    // console.log('team3: ', team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[2] = 'Logan';
    // console.log('team4: ', team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'hjadfsb';
    // console.log('team5: ', team5);

    // console.log('players: ', players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // actually makes a reference and manipulates the original.
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 50;
    // captain.newData = 'test';
    // console.log('captain: ', captain);
    // console.log('person: ', person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 64, newData: 'Hello'});
    // console.log('cap2: ', cap2);
    // console.log('person: ', person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person, age: 34, test: 'Please work'};
    // console.log('cap3: ', cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
